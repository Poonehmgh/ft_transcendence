Meeting
    - List of duties to help Fedia
    - Can remove socket from user model?
    - invite to game interaction
    - update prisma on game finish
    - muted until?


IMMEDIATE MULAIN
- pw hash
    - on chat creation
    - change password
    - active join password
- rerender on getting kicked: memberlist not rerendering
- have to refresh before memberlist renders, but only sometimes?!
- react to inviteEmission
- get chat message names not from chat but from backend? (Problem: user left chat/ kicked etc)


After testing complete:
- remove socket from user model
- remove functions that put socket into user model in backend

- Optimization (optional)
    - remove password functionality from non public chats:
        you cant join them anyway if you are not invited
    - add invite more users function to chats (that are not dms)
    - filter function for chats: filter dms, group chats, global chats
    - keeping banned users in chat as banned users not elegant.
    - best to remove chatusers completely tbh and go with simple arrays.
    - add invite game button to profile
    - add send msg button to profile
    - implement delete chat (not actually required lul)
    - streamline emit functions
    - specific update messages containing the to be updated information (no general re-renders)
    - change user status calls to single action (not bools for every possible action)
    - send message button in friend list
    - send message button in userprofilemodal
    - sharing one DTO location
    - Clean up DTO naming and amount of DTOs
    - Central handlers for backend service functions (try, return diff response types)
    - Enum for user rights in chat
    - avatar handling (show in chat and leaderboard)
    - paginate all users (maybe other things as well)
    - sorting options for all users
    - call older chat messages (standard grab of x, if want earlier, implement mechanism for that)
    - organize and standardize css
