(npm install --save-dev @types/react-modal)


--- notes meeting fedjrrrrr ---

- get last 50 msg function
- does a new chat being created and a user being part of it emit a socket event?
	- if not: how does the frontend know to update the user's channel list?
	- maybe don't need this, because this happens thru a "new chat request" emission?


--- to do ---

- check if DTO removable from frontend
- clean up use effect / use state in MyProfileModal
- rm ScoreCardDTO, just use user profile dto

- UserProfile
	- unify myProfile and other user profile, conditional render depending on calling user id
    - fetchGetSetify this

optional:
- leaderboard
	- show avatars
- all users
	- sortingmode
	- pagination
	- search for user by username / filter columns
