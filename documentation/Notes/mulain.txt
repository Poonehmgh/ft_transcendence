--- to do ---



- Optimization (optional)
    - specific update messages containing the to be updated information (no general re-renders)
    - sharing one DTO location
    - Clean up DTO naming and amount of DTOs
    - Central handlers for backend service functions (try, return diff response types)
    - Central handler for user interactions frontend
    - Enum for user rights in chat
    - avatar handling (show in chat and leaderboard)
    - paginate all users (maybe other things as well)
    - sorting options for all users
    - call older chat messages (standard grab of x, if want earlier, implement mechanism for that)
