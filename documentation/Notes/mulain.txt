--- to do ---
- stress test chat
    - create chat emit
    - (delete chat emit)
    - leave chat emit
    - rename chat emit
    - change user status emit
    - test muted 
    - test banned
    - kick from chat
    - test unbanned
    - test password
    - test password after change
- stress test invites
    - invitee in queue
    - invitee has blcoked inviter
    - invitee in game
    - invitee offline
- stress test game
- test 2fa auth
- test login with taken name
- updates after game:
    - match model
    - add match id to user model match[]
    - calculate new win rate and update user model winrate field
- dont forget to remove sensitive data from auth etc

- move auth frontend files from userprofile to manageprofile
- header to absolute values - care game!
- clean up unneccesary files
- clean up folder structure frontend
- clean up folder structure backend
- depcheck frontend, backend
- delete commented out functions





IMMEDIATE MULAIN
- banned not making rerender on the banned persons frontend (solved?)
- leavechat not making rerender on the other chatusers frontend (solved?)
- get names of members no longer in chat

- invite shoiuld fail if invitee is in queue
- ask fedia about isUserInQueue failing




- Optimization (optional)
    - token refresh
	- add userprofile to a provider
    - get chat message names not from chat but from backend? (Problem: user left chat/ kicked etc)
    - remove password functionality from non public chats:
        you cant join them anyway if you are not invited
    - add invite more users function to chats (that are not dms)
    - filter function for chats: filter dms, group chats, global chats
    - keeping banned users in chat as banned users not elegant.
    - best to remove chatusers completely tbh and go with simple arrays.
    - add invite game button to profile
    - add send msg button to profile
    - implement delete chat (not actually required lul)
    - streamline emit functions
    - specific update messages containing the to be updated information (no general re-renders)
    - change user status calls to single action (not bools for every possible action)
    - send message button in friend list
    - send message button in userprofilemodal
    - sharing one DTO location
    - Clean up DTO naming and amount of DTOs
    - Central handlers for backend service functions (try, return diff response types)
    - Enum for user rights in chat
    - avatar handling (show in chat and leaderboard)
    - paginate all users (maybe other things as well)
    - sorting options for all users
    - call older chat messages (standard grab of x, if want earlier, implement mechanism for that)
    - organize and standardize css
